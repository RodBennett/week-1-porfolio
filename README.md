# week-1-porfolio

In this assignment, I met all of the requiremnts of the user story by taking the following actions:
 - Consolidated a few lines in the HTML source code for easier readability (i.e., brought <p> tags up to wrap the text in the same line).
 - Substituted a few of the <div> elements with semantic ones (header, nav, figure, section, etc)

 - Distinguished "class" and "id" elements for greater ease of identification and future modification in the CSS file.
 - Deleted unnecessary <div> "classes," and renamed a few to match for greater CSS consolidation.

 - Added "alt" attributes to all images and icons, except for the main image at the top of the <body>.
 - Arranged the CSS elements to follow the HTML structure for greater ease of modification.
 - Consolidated several of the CSS elements to reduce redunancy, to add simplicity, and to preserve better structural itegrity with HTML code.
